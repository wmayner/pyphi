# Approximations and theoretical options
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# In certain cases, making a cut can actually cause a previously reducible
# concept to become a proper, irreducible concept. Assuming this can never
# happen can increase performance significantly, however the obtained results
# are not strictly accurate.
ASSUME_CUTS_CANNOT_CREATE_NEW_CONCEPTS: false
# When determining the MIP for Î¦, this restricts the set of system cuts that
# are considered to only those that cut the inputs or outputs of a single node.
# This restricted set of cuts scales linearly with the size of the system; the
# full set of all possible bipartitions scales exponentially. This
# approximation is more likely to give theoretically accurate results with
# modular, sparsely-connected, or homogeneous networks.

CACHE_REPERTOIRES: true
# Controls whether the potential purviews of the mechanisms of a network are
