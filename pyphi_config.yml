# Theoretical approximations

# In certain cases, making a cut can actually cause a previously reducible
# concept to become a proper, irreducible concept. Assuming this can never
# happen can increase performance significantly, however the obtained results
# are not strictly accurate.
ASSUME_CUTS_CANNOT_CREATE_NEW_CONCEPTS: false
# When evaluating the minimum information partition, only consider cuts that
# cut off a single node. It is possible that the MIP cut will cut off multiple
# nodes, but this approximation is usually correct, and at worst provides an
# upper bound for integrated information.
