def block_cm(cm):
    '''Return whether ``cm`` can be arranged as a block connectivity matrix.

    If so, the corresponding mechanism/purview is trivially reducible.
    Technically, only square matrices are "block diagonal", but the notion of
    connectivity carries over.

    We test for block connectivity by trying to grow a block of nodes such
    that:

    - 'source' nodes only input to nodes in the block
    - 'sink' nodes only receive inputs from source nodes in the block

    For example, the following connectivity matrix represents connections from
    ``nodes1 = A, B, C`` to ``nodes2 = D, E, F, G`` (without loss of
    generality, note that ``nodes1`` and ``nodes2`` may share elements)::

         D  E  F  G
      A [1, 1, 0, 0]
      B [1, 1, 0, 0]
      C [0, 0, 1, 1]

    Since nodes |AB| only connect to nodes |DE|, and node |C| only connects to
    nodes |FG|, the subgraph is reducible, because the cut ::

      A,B    C
      ─── ✕ ───
      D,E   F,G

    does not change the structure of the graph.
