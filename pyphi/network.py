class Network:
    '''A network of nodes.

    Represents the network we're analyzing and holds auxilary data about it.

    Args:
        tpm (np.ndarray): The transition probability matrix of the network.

            The TPM can be provided in either state-by-node (either
            2-dimensional or n-dimensional) or state-by-state form. In either
            form, row indices must follow the LOLI convention (see
            :ref:`loli-convention`). In state-by-state form column indices must
            also follow the LOLI convention.

            If given in state-by-node form, the TPM can be either
            2-dimensional, so that ``tpm[i]`` gives the probabilities of each
            node being on if the past state is encoded by |i| according to
            LOLI, or in n-dimensional form, so that ``tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives
            the probabilities of each node being on if the past state is
            |n0 = 0, n1 = 0, n2 = 1|.

            The shape of the 2-dimensional form of a state-by-node TPM must be
            ``(S, N)``, and the shape of the n-dimensional form of the TPM must
            be ``[2] * N + [N]``, where ``S`` is the number of states and ``N``
            is the number of nodes in the network.

    Keyword Args:
        connectivity_matrix (np.ndarray): A square binary adjacency matrix
            indicating the connections between nodes in the network.
            ``connectivity_matrix[i][j] == 1`` means that node |i| is connected
            to node |j|. If no connectivity matrix is given, every node is
            connected to every node **(including itself)**.
        node_labels (tuple[str]): Human-readable labels for each node in the
            network.

    Example:
        In a 3-node network, ``a_network.tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the transition
        probabilities for each node at |t| given that state at |t-1| was
        |n0 = 0, n1 = 0, n2 = 1|.
