class Network:
    """A network of nodes.

    Represents the network under analysis and holds auxilary data about it.

    Args:
        tpm (np.ndarray): The transition probability matrix of the network.

            The TPM can be provided in any of three forms: **state-by-state**,
            **state-by-node**, or **multidimensional state-by-node** form.
            In the state-by-node forms, row indices must follow the
            little-endian convention (see :ref:`little-endian-convention`). In
            state-by-state form, column indices must also follow the
            little-endian convention.

            If the TPM is given in state-by-node form, it can be either
            2-dimensional, so that ``tpm[i]`` gives the probabilities of each
            node being ON if the previous state is encoded by |i| according to
            the little-endian convention, or in multidimensional form, so that
            ``tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the probabilities of each node being ON if
            the previous state is |N_0 = 0, N_1 = 0, N_2 = 1|.

            The shape of the 2-dimensional form of a state-by-node TPM must be
            ``(s, n)``, and the shape of the multidimensional form of the TPM
            must be ``[2] * n + [n]``, where ``s`` is the number of states and
            ``n`` is the number of nodes in the network.

    Keyword Args:
        cm (np.ndarray): A square binary adjacency matrix indicating the
            connections between nodes in the network. ``cm[i][j] == 1`` means
            that node |i| is connected to node |j| (see :ref:`cm-conventions`).
            **If no connectivity matrix is given, PyPhi assumes that every node
            is connected to every node (including itself)**.
        node_labels (tuple[str] or |NodeLabels|): Human-readable labels for
            each node in the network.

    Example:
        In a 3-node network, ``the_network.tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the
        transition probabilities for each node at |t| given that state at |t-1|
        was |N_0 = 0, N_1 = 0, N_2 = 1|.
