Caching
~~~~~~~

PyPhi can use Redis as a fast in-memory global LRU cache to store MICE objects,
reducing the memory load on PyPhi processes.

`Install Redis <http://redis.io/download>`_. The `redis.conf` file provided
with PyPhi includes the minimum settings needed to run Redis as an LRU cache:

.. code:: bash

    redis-server /path/to/pyphi/redis.conf

Once the server is running you can enable Redis caching by setting
``REDIS_CACHE: true`` in your ``pyphi_config.yml``.

**Note:** PyPhi currently flushes the connected Redis database at the start of
every execution. If you are running Redis for another application be sure PyPhi
connects to its own Redis server.
